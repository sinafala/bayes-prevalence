## Bayes Prevalence

In response to the need to estimate CV19 prevalence using sample survey data with properties that make traditional frequentist analysis difficult, we combined existing Bayesian approaches to build a new integrated Bayesian approach to solve these challenges:
1. Very low response including sampling units with no responses at all,
2. Very few positive cases,
3. Varying number of results from multiple low-quality antibody tests for each participant,
4. Antibody tests whose performance characteristics were very poorly described, and
5. The possibility of selective response.
